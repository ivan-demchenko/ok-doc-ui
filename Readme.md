# Doc viewer

Documentation viewer. *This is just a pet project for practicing Elm.*

[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) is a functional language with static typisation and infrastructure for creating web applications without runtime errors.

### Why?

Long time ago I had an idea of self-documenting projects. Thus, the documentation should be generated from file system using some atomated task. As a result, a JSON is generated. This app is a viewer for this JSON.

The examples of data structures can be found [here](https://runkit.com/raqystyle/express-test).

### How to run

```
elm-package install
elm-reactor
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
```
